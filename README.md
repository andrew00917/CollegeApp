This project was created in wish to benefit and used by Kalamazoo College as an official mobile app. The work was geared towards for the improvement of students', faculties', and staffs' campus life and communication. Also, to serve visiting students' and parents' navigation through the campus and their visiting experience. Unfortunately, because of school's current licensing with the third vendor, this project did not get to shine as we hoped.

Considering the overall size of this project, the timeline was rushed to finish this prototype, which implies that the code in this repo is functional but very rough and documentation is incomplete. However, despite the incompleteness, TechHab has agreed to make this a public repo in sole purpose of the education benefits for students who will be enrolled in mobile-related courses at, but not limited to, Kalamazoo College.

As of now, due to this app not actually hooked up to any database, whoever trying to login will not succeed. For demo-purpose and for targeted users who are not on campus such as visiting students and parents, we have provided the "Guest Mode". As for the bugs that were not initially found, please use the contact provided on the bottom of this page to notify us. However, there is no guarantee in that the reported bug will be fixed in timely manner.

Some of few functional aspect of this app at this demo state that would be helpful for daily life of the users who are on campus of Kalamazoo College are as followed:

* Dining hours and its availability
* Upcoming campus events and selected event to be imported into user's device calendar
